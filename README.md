# ProtectionIndicator
ProtectionIndicator is a personal project of mine where I try and create an extension over the span of a week, that adds a protection icon to each and every protected page. As of now, it only adds a black OOUI lock icon with a title explaining why the lock icon is there. 

Among the things that need to be done are
* Add support for customisation of the icon using javascript. I'll probably try to make this into a MediaWiki space on-wiki file thingy so that it can be manipulated per the wishes of the community.
* Check if adding support for FlaggedRevs is worth it.
* Convert the title into a OOUI popup and add some helpful links to it.

This extension is based on extension BoilerPlate.
